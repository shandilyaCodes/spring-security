Basic Auth
============

-> Client wants to communicate to the Server
-> Client sends a GET request to the server, gets back a 401 Unauthorised
-> GET request with Base 64 encoded Username and Password in the request header
-> Server checks if the username exists, if yes then verifies the password
-> If the authentication is successful, the server returns 200 OK

-> This kind of authentication is not much of an use in the modern web application where the user would have to send
   these credential information on every request. It's rather helpful in scenarios where we are communicating to the
   3rd party APIs

Implementing the Basic Auth in Spring Boot
=============================================

-> Make a configuration class, annotate it with the @Configuration
-> Also, annotate this configuration class with @EnableWebSecurity
-> The class would extend WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
-> We would override the "void configure(HttpSecurity http)" method
-> http
        .authorizeRequests() [Authorize Requests]
        .antMatchers("/", "index", "/css/*", "/js/*") [Filter these resources at these URLs]
        .permitAll() [Permit access to the filtered URLs obtained in the ant matchers section]
        .anyRequests() [For Any other request]
        .authenticated() [It would be authenticated]
        .and()
        .httpBasic(); [Using the Basic Authentication mechanism]

-> The bad part about this type of basic auth is that we don't have the logout option, given the fact that the login
   information is shared to the server from the client on every request.

-> Once the container is killed and the application is restarted then the application would need authentication again

-> To test the same in POSTMAN, go to the Authorization section and select Basic Auth
-> Provide the combination of username and password and send the request
-> When we send the request, we get a success response
-> When we go to the headers section we can see that under the Authorization key there is an entry something like
   Basic dXNlcjpiOTg1ZDU5MS0yYzZlLTQ2N2EtYTYzMC03YmQ2OGZiNzNjYjg=, which tell the auth type is Basic and the remainder
   of the String is the combination of username and the password in the Base64.
