-> In order to provide Spring Security support to the application we need to add the below dependency

   		<dependency>
   			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
   		</dependency>

-> Just on the addition of the above dependency we get the login page by default

-> The default username is the user and the password is automatically generated which can be picked from the Console o/p

-> To logout from this default login we need to navigate to the {base URL}/logout and click on the logout
