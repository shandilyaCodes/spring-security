Application Users
==================
In the case of the Basic Authentication, the default username was user and some random password was generate which was
stored in the in memory database. But when the application is started, all these information is lost, thus we strive to
persist these information in some actual database.

A typical User information would be containing the below information

-> UserName
-> Password (Must be encoded)
-> Role(s) (ROLE_NAME)
-> Authorities
-> and Some more depending on the use case ...
