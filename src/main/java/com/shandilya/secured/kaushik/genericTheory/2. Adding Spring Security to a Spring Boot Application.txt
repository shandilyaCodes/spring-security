Adding Spring Security To Spring Boot Application
===================================================

-> Add the spring-boot-starter-security in the pom.xml and it will configure a form authentication
-> By adding just the dependency on the classpath Spring boot is able to provide us the login page and form by the help
   of Filters
-> Spring Security puts in a filter (thanks to the underlying servlet technology) which examines all the requests to the
   application and allows or denies them wisely
-> Spring Security Default behaviour
   -> Adds a mandatory authentication for all the URLs (Except the Error Page URL)
   -> Adds a login form
   -> Handles the login error
   -> Creates a User and sets a default password
   -> Spring Security generates a new password each time you restart the app
   -> The default behaviour of the Spring security can be changed by providing these below configs in the application.pr
      file
      spring.security.user.name = foo
      spring.security.user.password = foo
