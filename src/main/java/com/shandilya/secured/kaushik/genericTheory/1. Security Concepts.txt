Five Spring Security Concepts
==============================

AUTHENTICATION
--------------
-> This asks the question "Who Are You?" and this is answered by sharing some sort of Identification entity (UID/PWD)

=> There are two kind of authentication
    -> Knowledge Based Authentication
       -> In this kind of authentication an Identification Entity e.g. Password, Pin Code, etc is shared
       -> Knowledge Based Authentication is easy to implement but is not secured
    -> Possession Based Authentication
       -> This way it tries to identify if you are in the possession of something so that can verify that you are the
          real slim shady!
       -> E.G. : Phone/Text Messages, key cards/badges, Access Token Device etc.

=> Some applications use a mix of Knowledge Based and Possession Based Authentication, which is referred to as Multi
   Factor Authentication.


AUTHORIZATION
--------------
-> This answers the question "Can this user do this?" It's a yes/no question
-> So as the first step we ask the question who is the person who is trying to login to a system and as the second
   questions we ask is, "Is the User allowed to do whatever they are trying to do?".


PRINCIPAL
----------
-> Principal is the currently logged in User. It identifies the person who has authenticated


AUTHORITY (GRANTED AUTHORITY)
------------------------------
-> Authority or Granted Authority in Spring Security is a bunch of Permissions defined by the application maker which
   defines what part of the application a given logged in user is allowed to use
-> These are fine grained permissions of what the user can do


ROLES
------
-> The problem with the Authority in the above concept is that it's too much of configuration to do once a new user is
   created. So ROLES can be thought of as a bucket or umbrella of certain Authorities
-> A person with a given ROLE can have a set of given authorities and thus a matching ROLE can be assigned to a user
   rather than assigning all the concerned authorities to the user
-> Where the authorities are fine grained permissions, roles are more coarse grained permissions
