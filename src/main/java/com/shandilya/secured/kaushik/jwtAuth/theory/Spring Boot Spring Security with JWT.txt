Spring Boot Security With JWT
------------------------------

Objectives {
    -> Create new authentication API endpoint
    -> Examine every incoming request for valid JWT and authorize
}

Step 1 : A /authenticate API endpoint
        -> Accepts userID & password
        -> Returns JWT as response

Step 2 : Intercept all incoming requests
        -> Extract JWT from the header
        -> Validate and set in execution context
