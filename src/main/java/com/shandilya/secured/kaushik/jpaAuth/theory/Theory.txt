Flow in case of the JPA authentication in Spring Boot Security App
=====================================================================

-> Create an entity which holds the USER details, let's call it User
-> The entries of the User table would be
   {
        id, active, password, roles, user_name
   }

-> Create the Config file holding the configuration for the JPA authentication
-> Autowire private UserDetailsService userDetailsService
-> Inside the authentication logic do auth.userDetailService(userDetailsService)

-> Extend UserDetailsService with the class name as MyUserDetailsService and override the method loadByUserName
-> Make use of the UserRepository to load the user object by the userName and return the instance of UserDetails
